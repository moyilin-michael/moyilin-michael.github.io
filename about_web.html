<h1>Website Description</h1>
<p class = "web_description"> 
I am a computer science student currently enrolling in the University of Waterloo. I am interested in building websites and softeware engineering. I started learning things about 
websites since high school, but not until May 2020 did I make up my mind to build my first personal website. I bought a domain name, and used the free github page as my server
(thanks github for saving me a fortune). Although the storage is only 1GB, it is enough for daily use. Then I started learning HTML to design my webpage. In August, I noticed a 
post on a cs online forum called CSDN, and it is about a personal blog framework. This idea soon attracted me. Imagine how cool it is to have a personal blog, where you can freely
post stuff in your daily life. It is like a Twitter that belongs to you! So I used that framework on my website, changed some material in the original HTML code, and this is the origin 
of this blog! </p>
